# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

This project is a modern web application built using React.js, a popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces. The project leverages the power of SCSS for advanced styling capabilities, enabling the use of variables, nesting, and reusable mixins to enhance design consistency and maintainability.

The core technologies used in this project include:

React.js: For building dynamic, component-based UI.
JavaScript: As the primary programming language for logic and interactivity.
SCSS: For modular, maintainable, and advanced styling.
CSS: For additional minor styling adjustments.
HTML: For the basic structure, though minimized in React projects.
Key Features:

Component-based architecture for better code organization.
Responsive design using SCSS.
Dynamic functionality powered by React state management and hooks.
Clean, maintainable codebase by separating logic, styles, and presentation.
This combination of technologies ensures the project is both visually appealing and functionally robust, suitable for modern web development needs.
